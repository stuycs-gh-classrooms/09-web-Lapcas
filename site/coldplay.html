      <p class="picbox-text">There are other songs that I like more than any Coldplay song but in my opinion, they are the most consistent band/artist at making good music</p>
      <p class="picbox-text">In adition, their concerts are also very entertaining and are known as some of the best. They aren't only good at making music but also entertaining people</p>
