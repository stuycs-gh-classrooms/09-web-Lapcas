    <h1>The 3 Hardest Geometry Dash Levels</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Avernus by PockeWindfish</li>
      <li>Acheron by ryamu</li>
      <li>Silent Clubstep by TheRealSalient</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Avernus</h2>
    <p>This is considered one of the worst geometry dash levels
      even though it's the hardest, it's only been beaten by one person,
      even after almost a year of it being out. Here is the link to the verification video</p>

    <h2>Acheron</h2>
    <p>Many still consider this the hardest level in the game, even though it's #2 on the demonlist
    it's also considered really bad but not as bad as Avernus</p>

    <h2>Silent Clubstep></h2>
    <p>This level was originally released 7 or 8 years ago with the intention of it being impossible,
      after many people racing to beat it, it finally was a few years ago.<p>
